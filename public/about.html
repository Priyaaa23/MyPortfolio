<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>Hello! I'm a passionate tech enthusiast, starting my journey as a 23-year-old coder with a deep interest in web development and software engineering.
 I have hands-on experience in various programming projects, including an Enhanced Autism Segmentation tool using LSTM for improved diagnosis and a secure Blockchain-based certificate management system. 
 My technical toolkit spans from Python to Java, and I'm currently building my skills in web development, diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

 <p>My portfolio includes projects like a Programming Book Recommendation System, a Multilingual Text Translation Tool, and I've even had a stint as a Salesforce Administrator.
   I recently completed an internship from Bharat Itern as a Web Developer.Alongside my projects, I’ve completed an internship as a Salesforce Administrator, which taught me the importance of structured data management and client-oriented solutions. I’ve also had the chance to interview for the TCS Digital role, further fueling my drive to join a company where I can tackle complex challenges and continue learning. 
   Recently, I was selected for Accenture, though I’m navigating some account setup issues before officially beginning my journey there.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I'm documenting my journey on Instagram, where I share my progress and insights to inspire others. I'm driven by a strong desire to make a meaningful impact, and I'm excited about where this path will take me!
  When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new tech trends or watching films that inspire resilience, like Amaran, the biopic of an army officer's journey.
 I’m driven by a strong desire to contribute to projects that merge technical innovation with a positive impact, and I’m excited for the next steps on this incredible journey!
 Currently, I’m expanding my skill set in web development. I've started with HTML and basic front-end design, working on small projects to cement my understanding of website structure, interactive elements, and user experience. This is part of my ongoing documentation journey, which I share on my Instagram profile to connect with and inspire others embarking on their coding paths.
